# WRECKEM: NCAA Men's Basketball Game Predictor

## Overview
Welcome to the WRECKEM repository, a predictive model named in honor of Texas Tech University, designed to forecast outcomes of NCAA Men's Basketball games. Leveraging the principles of the ELO ranking system, this model integrates NCAA quad wins statistics and KenPom efficiency scores to predict game outcomes with enhanced accuracy.

## Model Description
WRECK_EM is rooted in the ELO ranking system, a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in competitor-versus-competitor games. The model adapts this system to the dynamic and competitive world of NCAA Men's Basketball by incorporating:

- **NCAA Quad Wins Statistics**: A key metric reflecting the quality of wins based on the location and opponent's ranking, available [here](https://stats.ncaa.org/selection_rankings/nitty_gritties).
- **KenPom Efficiency Scores**: Critical for assessing the offensive and defensive efficiency of teams, available [here](https://kenpom.com/).

By running 500 simulations for every game based on various regressions, WRECK_EM aims to provide a detailed probabilistic forecast for each matchup.

## Getting Started
Instructions to set up and run WRECK_EM will go here, including any dependencies, how to clone the repository, and steps to run the model.

Please note, KenPom efficiency scores are proprietary and require a subscription to access.
